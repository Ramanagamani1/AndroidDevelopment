        Usually, people talk about a mother’s love and affection, in which a father’s love often gets ignored.
        A mother’s love is talked about repeatedly everywhere, in movies, in shows and more. Yet, what we fail
        to acknowledge is the strength of a father which often goes unnoticed.Father’s a blessing which not many
        people have in their lives. It would also be wrong to say that every father is the ideal hero for their kids
        because that is not the case. However, I can vouch for my father without any second thoughts when it comes
        to being an ideal person.My Father is Different!As everyone likes to believe that their father is different,
        so do I. Nonetheless, this conviction is not merely based on the love I have for him, but also because of his
        personality. My father owns a business and is quite disciplined in all aspects of life.He is the one who taught
        me to always practice discipline no matter what work I do.<i><b>My Father is My Source of Inspiration.</b></i>
